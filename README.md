## ‚ú® Project Goals

- Apply **clean code** principles and **design patterns**.
- Enhance **software quality** using static analysis tools.
- Implement unit and functional tests.
- Practice **DevOps** techniques, including continuous integration and deployment.
- Develop mini-applications that integrate fundamental concepts.

## üõ§Ô∏è Roadmap

### Phase 1: Environment Setup
- [x] Create Docker containers for the application stack (PHP, MariaDB, Nginx).
- [x] Initialize Symfony project and configure initial setup.
- [x] Install composer dependencies.
- [x] Create a Makefile for common development tasks.
- [x] Add initial database migrations.

### Phase 2: Initial Development
- [x] Develop Bounded contexts
  - [ ] Users
  - [ ] PHP Watch viewer
  - [ ] Products
- [ ] Implement user registration and authentication.

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement CQRS for separation of read/write concerns.
- [ ] Apply design patterns.

### Phase 4: Testing and Quality Assurance
- [x] Set up static code analysis tools (PHPStan, ESLint).
- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests using PHPUnit.
- [ ] Add functional and integration tests using Cypress.
- [ ] Ensure high code coverage with automated testing tools.

### Phase 5: DevOps and Deployment
- [ ] Configure CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions.
- [ ] Automate build and deployment processes.
- [ ] Deploy the application to a cloud platform (AWS or DigitalOcean).

### Phase 6: Advanced Practices
- [x] Introduce Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles.
- [ ] Implement event-driven architecture with message queues.
- [ ] Optimize application performance and scalability.

### Phase 7: Feedback and Continuous Improvement
- [ ] Gather user and team feedback on functionality and performance.
- [ ] Refactor and enhance code based on feedback.
- [ ] Expand documentation and improve developer onboarding.
